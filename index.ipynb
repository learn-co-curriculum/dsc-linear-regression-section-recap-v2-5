    "\n",
    "* ***Statistical modeling*** combines statistics and data to draw conclusions about real-world relationships\n",
    "  * When defining a statistical model, you use data understanding to define an ***independent variable*** (x) and a ***dependent variable*** (y)\n",
    "* A ***simple linear regression*** model defines the relationship between x and y as a straight line, ***y = mx + c***\n",
    "  * The fitted model ***parameters*** are the best-fit values for m (slope) and c (intercept)\n",
    "  * The ***least-squares*** method allows you to calculate a \"closed-form\" best fit by minimizing the model error\n",
    "* You can ***evaluate*** linear regression models overall, as well as their parameters\n",
    "  * The ***F-statistic*** indicates whether the model is statistically significant overall\n",
    "  * ***R-Squared*** (coefficient of determination) describes the amount of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the model\n",
    "  * Parameters have ***coefficient*** values that describe the change in the dependent variable associated with a unit change in the independent variable, as well as ***p-values*** and ***confidence intervals*** created using the t-distribution\n",
    "* ***StatsModels*** is a useful library for fitting and evaluating linear regression models, using the `OLS` class\n",
    "  * You can also use StatsModels to find the model ***residuals***, i.e. the differences between the true values and the values predicted by the model"
